## Using streamlit
  Save the housinmg_streamlit.py and housing-deployment-reg.csv file in a folder. Check whether you have already installed the streamlin or not. If not then run the following code on terminal 
  "pip install streeamlit".
  Open a new terminal and run the following:
  "streamlit run "housinmg_streamlit.py". This will pop-up a new window which will give a list of the houses based on the number of rooms, car garages and the sale price. You can see all the houses are listed on cheap from top.
