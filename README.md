# Software_development
 Check whether you have already installed the streamlit or not. If not then run the following code on terminal 
 
       "pip install streeamlit".
       
## Movies recommended based on a user's rating

In this we have a data of movies with movieId and ratings of movies with userId. We use the cosine similarity to predict the ratings of the movies with other userId to forecast thier interests. Finally we develop an app using Streamlit with that one can find a list of top rated mivies by a userId reference. This will give an imapcat when a user "A" has a similar interests with another user  "B" then we can recommend  "A" to watch the top rated movies to the user. In this way Reecommender System is going to help to all the users. 

I will define a code in the file "movies_app.py". Once you run  "streamlit run movies_app.py" it opens a window with that you can all the movies with your querry. 

## Using streamlit
  Save the housinmg_streamlit.py and housing-deployment-reg.csv file in a folder.
  Open a new terminal and run the following:
  
     "streamlit run "housinmg_streamlit.py"
  
This will pop-up a new window which will give a list of the houses based on the number of rooms, car garages and the sale price. You can see all the houses are listed on cheap from top.
